# ITAI2373 NewsBot Midterm Project

## Overview
This project is for the NLP Systems Midterm. It demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques by cleaning, analyzing, and classifying news articles.

## Dataset
The project uses the **News Category Dataset** from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset

## Steps Completed
1. Imported and cleaned the dataset  
2. Preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)  
3. Visualized category distribution  
4. Applied machine learning for classification  
5. Displayed evaluation metrics and insights  

## My Contribution
I completed all project steps individually and handled the data preparation, model building, and visualization process.

## How to Run
Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells in order.
